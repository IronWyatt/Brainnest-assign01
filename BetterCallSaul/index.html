      Introducing Jimmy McGill. You may know him better as Saul Goodman, Walter
      White's slippery, resourceful lawyer in Breaking Bad. When first we meet
      him it is a few years before he meets Walter White. He is a struggling
      lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He mostly defends small-time crooks and
      represents people in civil liability claims. His brother, Charles "Chuck"
      McGill, is a senior partner at a prestigious Albuquerque law firm but
      hasn't left his house for several months due to a strange affliction.
      Jimmy is supporting him through bringing him groceries and the like. Jimmy
      has a dark, pre-lawyer past, being a small-time fraudster in Chicago
      before moving to Albuquerque to start over and work with at his brother's
      firm. We also meet Mike Ehrmantraut, ex-cop now working as a toll booth
      attendant at the courthouse parking lot. We see how Jimmy and Mike's
      stories converge and how Jimmy slowly becomes the Saul Goodman we know
      from Breaking Bad.
